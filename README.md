# Solana Wallet Dashboard

This project is an Solana Wallet Dashboard built with Next.js and Solana. The dashboard allows users to connect their Solana wallets and provides several functionalities related to NFTs and transactions on the Solana blockchain. 
The app features four main tabs: "NFT Display," "Transaction History," "Create NFT," and "Faucet."

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- A Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom)

### Installation

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## Features

### NFT Display

The "NFT Display" tab shows all the NFTs owned by the connected wallet. It fetches and displays metadata for each NFT, providing a detailed view of the user's NFT collection.

### Create NFT

The "Create NFT" tab allows users to mint a new NFT. Users can fill in details such as the title, description, symbol, and upload an image. Upon submitting, the app will handle the minting process and add the newly created NFT to the user's collection.

### Faucet

The "Faucet" tab provides a way for users to request SOL from a test faucet. Users can specify the amount of SOL they want to request, and the app will handle the airdrop process. This is useful for testing purposes and for users who need SOL to perform transactions on the Solana devnet.
